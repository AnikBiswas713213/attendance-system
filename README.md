# attendance-system
This version of code was created on 17th of August and hasn't been changed so far.

In the code, the "people/" direcotry contain the images of the attendees
The while loop can be modified to take pictures at a higher or a slower rate. In this code the while loop has been set to take exactly 3 pictures in 2 second intervals.
The time complexity of the program is O(n); it includes a for loop.
A custon tensflow build algorithm was supposed to be used for image recognition but OpenCV had faster and more efficient algorithm, just shape of the images from the cameras and the images of the attendees should match else the program will throw an error.
PAths haven't been added to this code, so that it can be modified later on use on a different device.
